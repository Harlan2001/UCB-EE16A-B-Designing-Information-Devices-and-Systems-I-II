# EECS16A : Designing Information Devices and Systems I

In the freshman introductory course for UC Berkeley electronics students, through the teaching of basic knowledge of circuits and various hands-on LABS, students can experience collecting and analyzing information from the environment through circuits, making predictions and feedback.Because of the pandemic, all LABS have remote online versions
